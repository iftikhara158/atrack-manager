## Overview

Traccar Manager is the official mobile app for managing and monitoring your GPS tracking devices with the open-source Traccar platform.

- **Live Tracking**: View the real-time location of all your devices on an interactive map.
- **Device Management**: Add, edit, or remove devices directly from your mobile device.
- **Event Notifications**: Receive alerts for geofence crossings, device status changes, and more.
- **History and Reports**: Review past routes and generate trip history for any device.
- **Secure and Private**: All your data stays on your own serverâ€”no third-party access.
